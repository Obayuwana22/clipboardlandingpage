## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.computer {
  width: 100%;
  transform: translateX(-10vw);
}
```

### Continued development

I saw alot of areas where more development is really needed such as giving my classes a more meaningful and descriptive names. I would continue to work on that and also using width property.
